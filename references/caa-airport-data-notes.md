For international routes, table 12.1, this includes passengers travelling worldwide on a flight either to/from a UK reporting airport. For domestic routes, table 12.2, which was introduced with effect from June 2001. Information is not available prior to this time.

Note: passengers travelling both from and to the UK would be counted as 2 passengers.

Terminal and Transit passengers

1) A terminal passenger is a passenger joining or leaving an aircraft at the reporting airport. A passenger travelling between two reporting airports is counted twice, once at each airport. A passenger who changes from one aircraft to another, carrying the same flight number (change of gauge) is treated as a terminal passenger, as is an interlining passenger.

2) A transit passenger is a passenger who arrives at and departs from a reporting airport on the same aircraft which is transiting the airport. Each transit passenger is counted once only and not both on arrival and on departure
